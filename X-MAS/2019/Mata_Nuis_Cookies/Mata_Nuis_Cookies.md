# Mata Nui's Cookies

![chall]

This challenge is the first Cryptography challenge and is a simple cipher. Along with the challenge you are given an image which is some symbols.

After doing some very quick googling came across the Bionicle Wiki page for the Matoran Language... Yeah, it's Bionicles. On the Wiki there is also an image of the Matoran Alphabet along with the English alphabet equivalents.

Then I did some quick substitution and came out with the flag: `X-MAS{MATANUIHASPREPAREDTHECOOKIES}`.

## Closing thoughts on the challenge

There isn't much really to say about this challenge beyond the fact that the challenge is a reference to Bionicles...
